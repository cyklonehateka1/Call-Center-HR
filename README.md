# Call-Center-HR
A simple yet powerful AI powered system for recruiting call agents for a call center. #(I still believe in humans being call agent, because why not?)

The System lets applicants fill out a form with their basic details. It takes then them to another page where they engage in a test.
The AI lets the Applicant select his/her preferred choice of language and asks them five question in the language to test their proficiency, eloquency, tone, among others.
The applicant is required to record his/her reply to the questions and the system will send it to the AI for analysis.

The AI analyzes the recording the applicant made and grades them on a scale of 1 to 100 based on the aforementioned criteria.
The system then records the applicant's credentials, together with the grade he/she got and the transcript of the reply of the recording the applicant made.
The human HR team can now query for the data of applicants whose score is above a certain number without having to manually test and review each applicant/application one after the other.
